##Current Bugs

###Landing Page

- Currently everything is boxed into a corner, try utilize whitespace
- implement an 'earthy' color scheme for a natural heathy mood
- Adjust title padding (the p is too close to the bottom border)
- Remove underline from recipe list
- add images of recipes on landing page
- place recipe list in the center of landing page and align as row
- add hover effects
- page load-in effects

###Recipe pages

- add list bullets to ingredients
- set a border around recipe image to seperate from background (and perhaps a box shadow effect)
- move image to one side for a more landscape orientation (keep vertical for mobile)
